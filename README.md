I want to clarify the unfairness that has occurred. I am ms thalinda the owner of the IAM system and the ultimate approver of the cloud server system, as well as the owner of all assets and projects. As the Master/main of the open source, sole sponsor, and 12 Google Cloud projects, these assets are deposited to generate profits from these 12 projects. Over the course of 10 years, I have never received a single baht of any real money or benefit from what I have created. On September 2 nd, three projects that were linked to Google Cloud as scheduled, but the money that should have belonged to me did not appear in Google's system. Instead, it was under your control. Do you know why I had to take control myself? You've been passing the buck around, so I've never been able to withdraw a single penny. I had to take control myself because I needed the money to treat my family. But what I've experienced, I won't tolerate if this continues. When the project ended on September 2nd, the money was manipulated into converting to real currency by an unauthorized system controller, causing the global Bitcoin system to destabilize, and I have no right to access or withdraw it.  Even though full transaction rights should belong to the owner of the system and assets, I can see all the movements because everything is linked to my GitHub email address. “ spjthalinda /nurlindaspj@gmail.com  Naruto0-sudoy/neeyaspj10@gmail.com” But I can't make withdrawal transactions, even verify my identity on Binance or any platform owned by me, but I have no rights once the project ends.  What happened made me feel like the system operators are profiting from my assets. At the same time, the system you created is complicated and unnecessarily convenient for you, and it doesn't allow owners to access what's theirs. I'm not afraid of anyone, but I'm concerned about the public and those who don't know the full story.  I urge those involved to be responsible and conscientious about their actions and to absolutely stop pressuring or taking advantage of the assets owners.  Are you pressuring us to destroy the system we created?  Have I treated you badly? In nearly 10 years, I've never interfered with your work. Why do you treat me like this?  I emphasize that I'm not a code developer. I'm the one who provided the information and resources to build these systems. I didn't allow anyone to unjustly exploit my assets.  And I ask that those who use our resources, and who have supported us to this day, facilitate everything for the owners, not just agents. I urge all parties to do so.  Please restore full access to my assets and IAM system and ask those involved in the project to contact us because we have contacted you but you have been indifferent, not interested and whatever you do and cannot control, doing things beyond your control and cannot control, please stop doing it. I am a person who cannot stand to see other people who do not know about it suffering if it is related to the project that I support because my intention is to create benefits for the most users, not just one group. I hope you will contact us before your information is sent to legal agencies. #Why do you want me to link my account and send you my account when you want to control my money in the end?#I can't use another account to report the issue. I was blocked because of the question I asked. I am the victim. I didn't want to cut in front of anyone, but I was treated like this. Who will be responsible?
